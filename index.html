    <p> <strong>The Story:</strong> COLORISTICO is a company that produces publishing materials for activities that develop cognitive and socioemotional skills in children ages 2 to 10.<br>
        The Coloristico Bookstore was created in 2018 during an education congress in the city of Vancouver after a partnership between Pedagogue Vanessa Lima and Mental Calculus Champion, Sabrina Kanashiro. The two understood that children's bookstores could be more inclusive, where customers from 3 to 15 years old could share their experiences in a playful and attractive space.
        The development of activities that improve memory, logical thinking, concentration, and mental calculation are extremely important for all children, as well as socioemotional skills, which consist of an individual's ability to get along well with himself (intrapersonal aspect) and others around him (interpersonal aspect). Therefore, they are positive behavioral skills for life in society.
        A person with effective social-emotional management can better control the way he or she acts, feels, and thinks. In addition, she is able to deal with others, maintaining a healthier interpersonal relationship and becoming a citizen.
        It may sound simple, but we can't always develop social and emotional skills in the right way. It is important to have the support of family and school so that adolescents and children can master the processes of working, living, being, knowing, and learning.<br>
        <strong> What is its importance in education? </strong>
        It is very common for schools to focus only on the cognitive intelligence of the students, preparing them for the vestibular and other tests. However, it is important to have the balance to develop social and emotional education since early childhood education.
        Thus, the student needs stimuli to enhance the various emotions and the way to react to each one of them, according to events. By developing social and emotional skills, students form their personality and character, becoming adults who are responsible for their own actions.
